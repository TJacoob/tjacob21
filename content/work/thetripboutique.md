At The Trip Boutique, we are building an AI-based hyper-personalization platform for travel, with a mission to allow travellers to make their trips uniquely theirs. In my position as a Frontend Engineer, I'm responsible for the development of the frontend of the platform, as well as the development of the company's website.
