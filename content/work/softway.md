At Softway we develop websites for a variety of customers. We use HTML, CSS ( + Bootstrap and SASS ) and Javascript to create visually appealing and mobile responsive pages. My responsibilities include the development of the website frontend based on specific designs and integration with a custom PHP backend solution. I also have contributed to developing web stores using Shopify.
