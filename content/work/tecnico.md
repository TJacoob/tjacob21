During my years studying at [Instituto Superior Técnico](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) I was actively involved in students groups and activities such as [NEETI](http://neeti.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) and [AEIST](https://aeist.pt/). In these groups, I developed skills such as leadership, team group and handling of time-sensitive situations. I also had the opportunity to work and organize a magnitude of events such as [BreakingDev](http://breakingdev.pt/), [SET](http://set.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) and others, both from a logistics standpoint and also developing technological solutions.
