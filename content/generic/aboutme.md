During business hours I am a Junior Web Developer. Why? I believe in creating things, whatever they are, and Web Development is a way to create: websites, stores, management platforms, you name it. Through careful design and implementation, it is possible to make pretty much any tool a new reality for anyone around the world.

Tech-wise, I am an enthusiast of frontend frameworks, such as Vue or React, as they enable developers to build quickly and easily. Either proofs-of-concept or full-scale applications.

After hours, I am a huge fan of concerts, travelling and sports. Pick either one of these topics and we can talk about it for hours, over a beer or coffee.
