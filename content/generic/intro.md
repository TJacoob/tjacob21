My name is Tomás and I am a Frontend Developer at [Frotcom International](https://www.frotcom.com/) in Oeiras. I graduated from Técnico Lisboa in 2019 with a Masters in Engineering and Computer Science majoring in Interaction and Visualization. Currently, I work developing PHP-based websites for a variety of clients, using mostly frontend languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also enjoy exploring other front-end frameworks such as Vue and libraries such as Tailwind.
