Hello, my name is Tom√°s and I am a Frontend Engineer, based in Lisbon. Currently, I work at [The Trip Boutique](https://thetripboutique.co//), helping to create its AI-based travel personalization platform. I thoroughly enjoy building websites and platforms, that make people's lives and work easier. My prefered tool is VueJS and its related frameworks and libraries such as Nuxt. Outside of work I am passionate about sports and music, with a keen eye for concerts.
