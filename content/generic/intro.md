Hello, my name is Tom√°s and I am a Frontend Developer. Currently, I work at [Frotcom International](https://www.frotcom.com/), in Oeiras, helping to create its fleet management solution. I thoroughly enjoy building websites and platforms, that make people's lives and work easier. My prefered tool is VueJS and its related frameworks and libraries such as Nuxt. Outside of work I am passionate about sports and music, with a keen eye for concerts.
