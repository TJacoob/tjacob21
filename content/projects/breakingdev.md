BreakingDev is a Hackathon for university students organized by NEETI-IST from 2016 to 2019. I was a part of the team that organized the first edition back in 2016 and have been involved in the organization until 2019.
This event allowed me to understand the complexities of large scale events, from logistics to marketing. It also allowed me to work with an amazing team and spend some great days in the process.

Tech-wise, this event can be split in 4 different years. In 2016 I built a single website to advertise the event, but the following year, I felt the need to have a tool to manage enrolments and created a platform using MeteorJS. In this platform, you could signup for the event and build a team with other contestants. This allowed us, as an organization, to manage contestants and volunteers.
For 2019, I choose to build the platform from scratch using React. The backend was built using NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.

I built most of these platforms and was in charge of their design and conception from A to Z. You can check all the repositories on Github for [2016](https://github.com/NEETIIST/breakingdev), [2017](https://github.com/NEETIIST/BreakingDev17), [2018](https://github.com/NEETIIST/BreakingDev18) and [2019](https://github.com/NEETIIST/BreakingDev19).
