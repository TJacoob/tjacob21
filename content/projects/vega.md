Vega Viagens is a portuguese travel agency. For this work, developed at Softway, the client wanted a more modern website to display their offer of custom travel packages to their customers.
This was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript as main tools, Bootstrap and SASS, with PHP for the backend and custom CMS solution. The design was made in-house and I had the responsability to implement and integrate the website.
