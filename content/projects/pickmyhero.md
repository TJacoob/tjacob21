This was a year-long project [@Softway](https://www.softway.pt/portfolio/detalhe/pick-my-hero/1189/), consisting of a website selling personalized children books, where the user could personalize the story characters to resemble a real person. It was a labor of love from the entire team and required many hours of dedication. My responsibility was to develop and implement the desired design, including personalization forms and the checkout steps.
