GesteNature is an online store selling natural cosmetics and other beauty products. It was a large endeavour to bring to life and it was a project for a personal client. I designed, developed and maintain the entirety of the customer-facing website.

The website was developed using mainly NuxtJS and Tailwind. Being a store, SEO was a major concert. Nuxt and its server-side rendering handle that issue very well, creating a well-indexed website with a good performance and smooth page transitions. Tailwind was used as the main styling library, with some custom SCSS. Algolia is used as a search option on the website.

It uses Shopify as a backend/back office and for payment processing, using a custom-made integration with invoicing software.
