GasTracker is an online tool to record and track your car gas consumption. Each time you refuel, input some data about the refuel and it calculates the average consumption of your car. As you refuel more and more, the data becomes more accurate and displays the average consumption of your car.
The platform was built using Nuxt.js and Bootstrap. The current production website is hosted on Heroku using MongoDB Atlas as a cloud database provider.
